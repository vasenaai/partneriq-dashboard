## 🧠 Powered by the Pareto Principle

PartnerIQ uses the 80/20 rule to classify your contributors:

| Tier | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Tier A** | Top 20% of contributors (high-impact) |
| **Tier B** | Next 30% (moderate impact) |
| **Tier C** | Bottom 50% (low-impact or passive) |

This allows you to prioritize your outreach and retention efforts where they matter most.
